i made a website which basically calculates the carbon emitted from your car and im currently making an app for it
# Carbon Emission Calculator

This project allows users to calculate the carbon emissions of vehicles based on the type of fuel and the distance traveled.

## Features:
- Calculates emissions for **petrol**, **diesel**, and **electric** vehicles.
- Outputs the total emissions in **grams** based on the distance entered.

## Usage:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `carbon_emission_calculator.py` script.
3. Input the **fuel type** (petrol, diesel, electric) and **distance** in kilometers.
4. The calculator will display the total carbon emissions in grams for the entered distance.
the formula for it is :carbon emitted= (emission{g/km} x distance)
this can create a better environment and a better world by making poeople know the costs of using their cars too much on the earth.
